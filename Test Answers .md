**Are application permits being processed efficiently?**

- A possible metric for this question is the average time taken to process an application permit from submission to approval or rejection. This metric can be calculated by subtracting the submission date from the approval or rejection date for each application permit in the Annual report Board of Adjustments dataset. 
- The analysis should compare the average time taken across different years, months, types of units, and commercial types to identify any trends or patterns that might indicate inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the process. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all application permits are recorded in the dataset and that there are no missing or erroneous dates. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of processing time? What are the factors that influence the processing time? How satisfied are applicants with the process? What is the ratio of commercial types in other cities with excellent business growth? 

**What is the trend in opening/closures of businesses?**

- A possible metric for this question is the net change in number of businesses over time. This metric can be calculated by subtracting the number of closures from the number of openings for each year, month, type of unit, and commercial type. 
- The analysis should plot this metric over time to show how it varies across different periods and categories. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all openings and closures are recorded in the Annual report Board of Adjustments dataset and that there are no duplicates or errors in counting them. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: What are the reasons for opening/closing a business? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of business dynamics?

**Do residents feel that the City is safe and liveable?**

- A possible metric for this question is the resident satisfaction score. This metric can be calculated by conducting surveys among residents and asking them to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of the city, such as safety, cleanliness, amenities, services, etc. 
- The Quality of Life calls to the citizens can help the city to determine the issues by location and time. 
- 911 calls should be analyzed the same way with QoL calls. The type of the call, location, time, and frequency need to be analyzed to see the pattern about the crime in the city.
- The analysis should aggregate and average the scores across different areas and demographics to get a comprehensive picture of how residents feel about the city. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that the surveys and calls are representative, reliable, and valid and that there are no biases or errors in collecting and analyzing them. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: How does resident satisfaction vary over time and across different groups? What are the main drivers and barriers of resident satisfaction? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of resident satisfaction?

**Are Public Safety response times decreasing?**

- A possible metric for this question is the average response time for public safety calls. This metric can be calculated by subtracting the call hour from the closed date for each call in the 911 Calls for Service dataset. 
- The analysis should compare the average response time across different years, months, call types, outcomes, and locations to identify any trends or patterns that might indicate improvements or challenges in public safety performance. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all calls are recorded in the dataset and that there are no missing or erroneous dates or times. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: How does public safety response time affect the outcome of the call? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of public safety response time? What are the factors that influence public safety response time? Is there any constraint for response times due to lack of personnel or the transportation in the city? 





**Are shootings (fatal & non-fatal) decreasing?**

- A possible metric for this question is the number of shootings per capita over time. This metric can be calculated by dividing the number of shootings (fatal & non-fatal) by the population size for each year, month, and location. Number of fatal crimes can be calculated from the 911 call log dataset by location and time. 
- The analysis should plot this metric over time to show how it varies across different periods and areas. These two datasets combined can help the city determine if the numbers are increasing or decreasing over the years. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all shootings are recorded in the Incidents Non-Fatal shootings dataset and in the 911 Calls dataset, and the population size is available from another source (not provided). 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: What are the causes and consequences of shootings? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of shooting rates? What are the strategies and policies to prevent and reduce shootings?

**What is the trend for other crime types?**

- A possible metric for this question is the number of crimes per capita over time by crime type. This metric can be calculated by dividing the number of crimes by the population size for each year, month, crime type, and location. This data can be taken from the 911 Call dataset and incidents non-fatal shootings dataset. 
- The analysis should plot this metric over time to show how it varies across different periods, categories, and areas. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all crimes are recorded in a separate dataset (not provided) and the population size is available from another source (not provided). 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: What are the causes and consequences of different crime types? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of crime rates? What are the strategies and policies to prevent and reduce crimes?

**What are the locations?**

- A possible metric for this question is the spatial distribution of different indicators over the city map. This metric can be calculated by mapping the latitude and longitude coordinates of different data points (such as calls, shootings, crimes, properties, etc) to a city map and using colors or symbols to represent their values or categories. 
- The analysis should visualize this metric on a map to show how it varies across different locations in the city. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all data points have valid and accurate coordinates and that there are no errors or outliers in mapping them. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: How does location affect different indicators? How does location interact with other factors (such as time, type, outcome, etc)? What are the hotspots or clusters of different indicators in the city?



**Are vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties dealt with in a timely manner?**

- A possible metric for this question is the average time taken to resolve a property issue from violation date to resolution date. This metric can be calculated by subtracting the violation date from the resolution date for each property in the Vacant-Foreclosed-Abandoned Properties dataset. 
- The analysis should compare the average time taken across different years, months, property types, and locations to identify any trends or patterns that might indicate efficiencies or delays in resolving property issues. 
- Some assumptions that are made are that all properties are recorded in the dataset and that there are no missing or erroneous dates. 
- Some further questions that can be asked are: How does resolving property issues affect the value and attractiveness of properties? How does Paterson compare with other cities in terms of resolving property issues? What are the factors that influence resolving property issues?
